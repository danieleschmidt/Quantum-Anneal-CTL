    AdaptiveQuantumOrchestrator,
    BreakthroughDetector,
    AutonomousResearchEngine
)

# Initialize autonomous controller
controller = SelfOptimizingController()

# Start autonomous optimization
controller.optimize_autonomous()

# Monitor breakthrough detection
detector = BreakthroughDetector()
breakthrough = detector.detect_breakthrough(performance_data)
```

```python
# Configure evolutionary strategies
controller.configure_evolutionary_strategy(
    population_size=100,
    mutation_rate=0.1,
    crossover_rate=0.8
)

# Enable neural optimization
controller.enable_neural_optimization(
    hidden_layers=[64, 32],
    learning_rate=0.001
)

# Set up multi-solver orchestration
orchestrator = AdaptiveQuantumOrchestrator()
orchestrator.add_solver("dwave", priority=1)
orchestrator.add_solver("local", priority=2)
```
