# Security Reference

## Production Security System

The quantum HVAC control system implements enterprise-grade security through the `ProductionSecuritySystem` class.

### Components

#### EncryptionManager
- **Purpose**: End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data
- **Algorithms**: AES-256-GCM, RSA-4096
- **Key Management**: Automated key rotation, secure key storage
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  from quantum_ctl.security import EncryptionManager
  
  encryption = EncryptionManager()
  encrypted_data = encryption.encrypt_sensitive_data(data)
  decrypted_data = encryption.decrypt_sensitive_data(encrypted_data)
  ```

#### AuthenticationManager
- **Purpose**: Multi-factor authentication for system access
- **Methods**: Password, token, biometric, hardware keys
- **Features**: Session management, timeout handling
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  from quantum_ctl.security import AuthenticationManager
  
  auth = AuthenticationManager()
  session = auth.authenticate_user(credentials)
  auth.validate_session(session_token)
  ```

#### AuthorizationManager
- **Purpose**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Features**: Fine-grained permissions, resource-level access
- **Roles**: admin, operator, monitor, guest
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  from quantum_ctl.security import AuthorizationManager
  
  authz = AuthorizationManager()
  has_access = authz.check_permission(user, "quantum_solver", "execute")
  ```

#### ThreatDetector
- **Purpose**: Real-time threat detection and mitigation
- **Detection**: Anomalous behavior, injection attacks, DoS attempts
- **Response**: Automatic blocking, alert generation
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  from quantum_ctl.security import ThreatDetector
  
  detector = ThreatDetector()
  threat_level = detector.analyze_request(request_data)
  ```

#### SecurityAuditLogger
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Events**: Authentication, authorization, threats, system changes
- **Compliance**: SOX, GDPR, HIPAA audit requirements
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  from quantum_ctl.security import SecurityAuditLogger
  
  logger = SecurityAuditLogger()
  logger.log_security_event("authentication_success", user_id, details)
  ```

### Quantum Security

#### QuantumSecurityManager
- **Purpose**: Quantum-specific security measures
- **Features**: Quantum key distribution, quantum-safe encryption
- **Protection**: Against quantum computing attacks

#### SecureQuantumSolver
- **Purpose**: Secure quantum solver communications
- **Features**: Encrypted solver queries, result validation
- **Protocols**: Quantum-authenticated channels

## Best Practices

### Authentication
1. Use strong passwords with multi-factor authentication
2. Implement session timeouts (15 minutes idle)
3. Log all authentication attempts
4. Use hardware tokens for admin access

### Authorization
1. Apply principle of least privilege
2. Regular access reviews and audits
3. Separate development and production environments
4. Implement emergency access procedures

### Data Protection
1. Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit
2. Use secure key management practices
3. Implement data classification schemes
4. Regular backup and recovery testing

### Monitoring
1. Continuous threat monitoring
2. Real-time alert systems
3. Security incident response procedures
4. Regular security assessments

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats
1. **Unauthorized Access**: Mitigated by MFA and RBAC
2. **Data Breaches**: Mitigated by encryption and access controls
3. **Denial of Service**: Mitigated by rate limiting and load balancing
4. **Insider Threats**: Mitigated by audit logging and segregation
5. **Quantum Attacks**: Mitigated by quantum-safe cryptography

### Security Controls
- Preventive: Authentication, authorization, encryption
- Detective: Threat detection, audit logging, monitoring
- Corrective: Incident response, system recovery
- Compensating: Manual overrides, backup systems
